/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VEO Studio Pro.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user has full control over their data,
 * and no data is shared between users without explicit mechanisms (not yet implemented).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database is structured as follows:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores profile information for each user. 'userId' MUST match the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/videos/{videoId}: Stores metadata for videos owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/images/{imageId}: Stores metadata for images owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/prompts/{promptId}: Stores prompts created by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing is allowed.
 * - Path-based ownership is enforced for all user-generated content (videos, images, prompts).
 * - Data validation is limited to checks essential for authorization and relational integrity.
 * - All write operations require authentication.
 * - get() calls are avoided in security rules by denormalizing data when required.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * Path-based ownership is used, so denormalization is not required for authorization. The `userId` in the path is sufficient.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User-owned data is stored in user-specific subcollections, ensuring data privacy and simplifying queries.
